These are the steps to update the stacked area chart on the project page:

1. Open `data/prepData.py` and update the names of the 4 datafiles (lines 43 - 46). Save the changes and run the script.
  - The dates in lines 66-72 may also need to be edited based on which quarters or years the researchers decide not to show.
